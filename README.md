# Working hours analysis

> Collects your Toggl time tracking events to enhance your working time analysis with python

Since I am using Toggl for time tracking the time records became much more accurate and
helps me to evaluate my own work and productivity.

To perform analyses and create customized visualisations with python and Grafana, I used the Toggl API to collect the data. For calculating
the target hours I have to work each week and month I am also stored the information to vacation days in config.py and pulled the data to puplic
holidays from suitable web pages.

# Working hours analysis

> Collects your Toggl time tracking events to enhance your working time analysis with python

Since I am using Toggl for time tracking the time records became much more accurate and
helps me to evaluate my own work and productivity.

To perform analyses and create customized visualisations, I began to retrieve the data from Toggl. To calculate
the hours I have to work each week and month I am also collecting information to vacation days, puplic holidays and
weekends.
